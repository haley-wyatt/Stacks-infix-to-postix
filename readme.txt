This is a project from my data structures class at UNR. The point of the project is to design and implement a stack data structure by creating a program that takes an infix expression as an input and returns that expression in postfix form.

Instructions to run code:
    This code is written in c++ and will compile in c++ version 11
    In bash terminal run the following commands:
        make
        ./executable

Included files:
    driver.cpp
    makefile
    readme.txt
    linkedstack.cpp
    linkedstack.h
    node.cpp
    node.h
    stackinteface.h
